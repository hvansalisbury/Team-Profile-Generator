## Installation

First clone all of the files from Github. Then open the command line and navigate to the "Develop" folder. Make sure to install node.js and npm inquirer.

## Usage

Once in the command line and in the "Develop" folder, open the application by typing "node app.js". Answer each of the prompts correctly. When completed, type "n" when asked to enter another employee. An output folder will be created. Inside that folder will be the team.html file. Open the html file in your browser to see all of your employees that you entered.

## Contributing

At this time, I am not looking for any additional contributors for this project.

## Tests

Tests are built into the code and can be run through the command line by typing "npm run test" in the "Develop" folder. Additionally, the app does not allow blank entries for the text inputs and only allows numbers in the number inputs as well as the @ symbol in the email prompt. Test all of those out by not including what is required.
